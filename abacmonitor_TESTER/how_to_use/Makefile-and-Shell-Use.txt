Introduction:

	Place the Makefile in the same folder as all of the code you are going to compile. rc.sh should be in the same directory.

	In that directory there should be a folder named "input" that has all the test cases. There should also be a directory named "output" with two sub-directories, "actual" and "expected". "actual" will be where all the files from your output will be placed. "expected" will have all of the files that are expected as output.

	This is operating under the assumption that you are executing on Linux and have all the required packages and permissions to execute.

Running and using rc.sh:

	Navigate to the directory that has "rc.sh", and in the command line type "chmod +x rc.sh". This will give you the ability to execute the file.

	rc.sh will automaticaly tell you if there are differences between what the program output and what was expected. In addition it will also sort the new files into the correct directory.

Example of how the base directory would look:

abacmonitor		<-- File made by the Makefile. This is the fully built project
input/			<-- Dir with all input test cases
inputbuf.cc
inputbuf.h
inputbuf.o
instructions/		<-- How to use the rc.sh and set up directories
lexer.cc
lexer.h
lexer.o
Makefile		<-- Make file for building the project. 
			    If you make files of your own, please change this to include them
output/			<-- Dir for all output, both the expected and actual
parser.cc
parser.h
parser.o
rc.sh			<-- Shell to execute the files
